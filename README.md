Game3
=====

A small RPG game build using slick and (hopfully) niffty.

This is just me messing around with Slick2D and the Simple User Interface lib for it.

Check out Slick2D here: http://slick.ninjacave.com/

Check out the SUI project here: https://code.google.com/p/slick-sui/

Notice that the SUI project is dead. However, the library that is up there is SUPER useful for simple GUI.
Just mess around with it and it'll work! :)
